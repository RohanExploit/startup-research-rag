"""
Build the consolidated `exam_results` analytics table (P3.9).

One row per (student, subject). Denormalized from the already-parsed
students + student_subjects tables. Derives `semester` from the subject code and
an `is_fail` flag, and tags provenance columns.

RETENTION-SAFE: reads the PII store (tabular.duckdb) with ATTACH ... (READ_ONLY)
and writes ONLY a separate analytics.duckdb. The raw PII DuckDB is never opened
for writing, never modified. CREATE OR REPLACE only affects analytics.duckdb.
