# Android client — design

**Date:** 2026-08-26
**Status:** design, approved, pending implementation plan

## What this is

A native Android app that asks the Company Brain a question — typed, spoken, or
photographed — and shows the answer with the documents it came from.

The engine already exists, is benchmarked at 88.9% over 208 questions, and runs
on the laptop. This app is the phone client for it. It is the phone-first half
of a system whose other half is already built and measured.

## Hard constraint: purely additive

Nothing that exists today changes. Not `retrieval/`, not `api/`, not
`generation/`, not `dashboard/`, not `tests/`.

This is achievable because the app needs no new backend capability:

- It calls the existing `POST /query` endpoint with the existing request shape
  (`{query, tenant_id}`) and reads the existing response
  (`{query_type, answer, context_used, metadata.sources}`).
- It authenticates with the existing `X-API-Key` header.
- It is a native HTTP client, so CORS does not apply — no `allowedDevOrigins`
  or CORS allowlist change.
- OCR runs on the device, so no image upload endpoint is needed.

The only operational change is a launch flag that already exists:
`scripts\demo_up.ps1 -Lan -ApiKey <key>`.

**Verification:** after the app is built, `pytest -q` and `cd dashboard && npm
run build` must both give the same result they give today. If either changes,
the constraint has been violated.

## Decisions taken

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Where the model runs | On the laptop; the phone is a client | The engine needs 4 GB of VRAM. The event's own framing is "Office Kit bridging the phone to deeper laptop compute when you need it." |
| Framework | Flutter | Already shipped a Flutter Android app. Genuinely native UI, not a webview. |
| Where it builds | GitHub Actions | No Android SDK, no Flutter SDK, no Gradle locally, and the installed JDK is 23 while the Android Gradle Plugin wants 17. CI runners have all of it. |
| OCR | On-device (ML Kit) | Keeps the backend untouched, works with no laptop, and counts as on-device AI. |
| Timing | Built before the event | Founder decision, taken with the "built at the venue" norm noted. |

## Scoring context

The event rubric is 75% jury, 25% device telemetry:

| Weight | Criterion | Scored by |
|---|---|---|
| 30% | End product quality — does it work, would someone keep using it | Jury |
| 20% | Novelty and impact | Jury |
| 15% | Creative phone use — camera, voice, on-device AI | HackTracker |
| 15% | Technical depth — architecture, robustness, real use of hardware | Jury |
| 10% | Office Kit usage — phone/laptop bridge | HackTracker |
| 10% | Demo and presentation | Jury |

Two consequences for this design:

1. **The 15% names camera, voice and on-device AI.** This app has all three:
   Android speech recognition, the camera, and ML Kit OCR running locally.
2. **Office Kit is not something this app integrates with.** It is a bridge
   tool — screen mirror, shared clipboard, file transfer, remote control —
   between phone and laptop, and its 10% is measured on usage while building,
   not on any app capability. There is nothing to build for it.

```

Voice and camera are both **input methods for the same question box**. Neither
introduces a second answer path. Speech produces text; OCR produces text; both
land in the composer where the user can edit before asking. This is why they
cost so little: the entire downstream path is the one that already works.

## File structure

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `mobile/lib/main.dart` | App entry, theme, route table |
| `mobile/lib/config/app_config.dart` | Base URL and API key; load/save via `shared_preferences` |
| `mobile/lib/api/brain_client.dart` | `POST /query` and `GET /health`; typed results; timeout and error mapping |
| `mobile/lib/models/answer.dart` | `Answer.fromJson` — route, answer text, sources |
| `mobile/lib/screens/ask_screen.dart` | The primary screen |
| `mobile/lib/screens/settings_screen.dart` | Server address, API key, connection test |
| `mobile/lib/widgets/answer_card.dart` | Answer, route badge, source list |
| `mobile/lib/widgets/mic_button.dart` | Voice control, listening state |
| `mobile/lib/services/speech_service.dart` | `speech_to_text` wrapper, permission handling |
| `mobile/lib/services/ocr_service.dart` | Camera capture + ML Kit text recognition |
| `mobile/test/` | Unit and widget tests, run in CI |
| `.github/workflows/android.yml` | Builds a debug APK on push, uploads as an artifact |

Each file has one responsibility, and the two services (`speech`, `ocr`) share
no state with each other — both simply return a `String` to the composer. That
boundary is what keeps either one removable without touching the other.

## The screens

**Ask screen.** The mic is the largest control on the screen — that is the
phone-first thesis made visible, not a decoration. Below it a text field, a
camera button, and a submit control. After a query: an answer card showing the
route badge (TABULAR / FACT / LOCAL / GLOBAL), the answer, and the source
documents listed underneath. The route badge matters — it is the visible proof
that four different retrievers exist behind one question box.

**Settings screen.** Base URL, API key, and a **Test connection** button that
calls `GET /health` and reports green or red.

That button is the most operationally valuable thing in the app. On a venue
floor, when the phone cannot reach the laptop, it turns a blind debugging
session into one tap.

## Connectivity, designed for a hostile network

**Venue wifi will likely not work, and this is the single largest delivery
risk.** Conference networks commonly enable client isolation: devices reach the
internet but not each other. The entire client/laptop design fails at check-in
if that is discovered live.

Order of preference, to be written into the runbook and rehearsed before the
event:

1. **Laptop hotspot.** Laptop runs the hotspot, phone joins it. No third party
   in the path, no isolation policy.
2. **Phone hotspot.** Phone shares its connection, laptop joins.
3. **USB tethering.** Cable between the two. Slowest to set up, hardest to
   break.
4. **Venue wifi.** Assume it does not work. Do not plan around it.

The app supports all four identically because the server address is editable
and persisted — switching networks is a settings edit and a connection test,
not a rebuild.

## Error handling

Every failure the user can hit gets a specific message, never a spinner that
never resolves:

| Condition | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| No server configured | Ask screen routes to settings on first launch |
| Connection refused / DNS failure | "Can't reach the laptop" + a shortcut to the connection test |
| HTTP 401 | "API key rejected" + shortcut to settings |
| HTTP 400 (empty query) | Inline validation before the request is sent |
| Timeout (30s default) | "The laptop is still thinking" — a cold model load genuinely takes ~60s |
| Microphone permission denied | Falls back to typing, with a one-line explanation |
| Camera permission denied | Falls back to typing, with a one-line explanation |
| OCR finds no text | "No text found in that photo" — does not send an empty query |

The timeout deserves its own note: the first query after a cold start waits on
the model loading into 4 GB of VRAM. A 30-second timeout with an honest message
beats a 10-second one that reports a failure that has not happened.

## Testing

Hermetic tests, run in the same CI job that builds the APK:

- `brain_client_test.dart` — response parsing for all four routes; 401, 400,
  timeout and connection-refused paths; header construction.
- `answer_model_test.dart` — `Answer.fromJson` including a response with an
  empty `sources` list (the GLOBAL route returns one) and a missing `metadata`
  key.
- `answer_card_test.dart` — widget test: renders route badge and source list;
  renders correctly with zero sources.

No test requires a running backend, a device, or a network.

## Out of scope

Deliberately excluded, each for a stated reason:

- **On-device generation.** A 2–4B model, the FAISS index and embeddings shipped
  as app assets is days of work with a real chance of not fitting or not being
  fast enough on the handset. The laptop path works today.
- **Query history.** Least impressive per hour of work of anything considered,
  and it adds local storage and a migration concern.
- **QR pairing.** Genuinely nice, but the settings screen plus a connection test
  solves the same problem, and the connection test is worth more on the floor.
- **Office Kit integration.** Nothing to integrate with; see Scoring context.
- **iOS.** No device, no build target, not scored.

## Open risk

The app cannot be tested on the actual loaner handset before the event — the
loaner is handed over at Saturday check-in. It must therefore be verified on
another Android device beforehand, and nothing in it may depend on a
device-specific capability. The two device features it uses, Android speech
recognition and ML Kit text recognition, are both standard across Android and
present on any modern handset.
