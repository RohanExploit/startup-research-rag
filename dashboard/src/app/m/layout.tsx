/**
 * The desktop console's chrome is declared in the root layout, which this route
 * cannot edit. Rather than duplicate the root layout, /m suppresses that chrome
 * for as long as it is mounted: an inline <style> (no `precedence`, so React
 * renders it in place and removes it on unmount) collapses the shell grid to a
 * single full-bleed cell and hides the status strip and sidebar. Navigating back
 * to the console restores everything, in dev and in production alike — which a
 * CSS-module `:global` block would not guarantee, since route CSS is kept alive
 * across soft navigations in development.
