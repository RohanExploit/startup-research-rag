"""Deterministic question-side entity linking for the LOCAL (graph) route.

The old LOCAL path fed the top vector hit's *source filename* to the graph,
which is keyed by extracted *entity names* — so it never matched and context
was always empty. This links entities mentioned in the QUESTION text to graph
nodes with no LLM (reproducible), tuned for PRECISION because a wrong entity
yields a wrong neighborhood.

Matching rules (high precision):
  * Multi-word node  -> its normalized form must occur in the normalized
    question on word boundaries (e.g. node "YSPM's Yashoda Technical Campus"
    matches "... Yashoda Technical Campus ..." via its "yashoda technical
    campus" core; we test node-core-in-question).
  * Single-word node -> the word must appear in the question AND be capitalized
    there (proper-noun heuristic), so common-noun graph junk like "trust",
    "college", "technical" can't spuriously match lowercase question words.
  * Prefer-longer dedup: drop a node whose normalized name is contained in a
    higher-ranked kept node (keeps "RAG-MicroSim", drops bare "RAG").
  * Fuzzy (rapidfuzz token_set_ratio >= threshold) only as a fallback when no
    exact/boundary match is found, and only for multi-word candidates.
