text = "High-frequency trading (HFT) methods work on sub-second time scales and often cause complicated market dynamics that are difficult to explain. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has evolved as a strategy to ground large language models (LLMs) with factual context, including domain-specific financial data[1][2]. However, RAG systems often rely on historical records or textual data and can struggle with rare or hypothetical scenarios[3]. We present RAG-MicroSim, a novel hybrid architecture that augments RAG with an integrated micro-simulation engine. RAG-MicroSim dynamically generates synthetic limit order book (LOB) states and trade events on demand, which are used alongside retrieved historical data. real-time risk assessment and anomaly identification, and permits testing of possible algorithmic behaviors not apparent in past logs.We go into detail on RAG-MicroSim's architecture, market microstructure simulation techniques, and integration plan with the RAG pipeline. In conclusion,"
