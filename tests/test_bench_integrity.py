"""Structural invariants of the world-model benchmark (tests/eval/bench/).

A benchmark degrades quietly. Someone enriches the corpus, and a document that now
mentions both halves of a two-hop question turns that question into a lookup — the score
goes UP and the slice silently stops measuring what it claims to. That is not hypothetical:
adding department profiles collapsed eleven LOCAL hops the first time, and only the
validator caught it.

So the properties the benchmark depends on are asserted here, and run with the suite.
