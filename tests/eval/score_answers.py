"""
SCORE half of the Phase-B RUN/SCORE split (see run_eval.py).

Scores a frozen answers JSONL produced by `run_eval.py --answers`. Costs no GPU, so a
scorer variant is a free replay rather than a fresh eval — and, more importantly, the
answers are written to disk *before* any scorer variant is authored, so a scorer cannot be
quietly shaped around the numbers it is meant to judge. Re-runnable by an auditor from the
same two files.

Scorers
    v1        the shipped run_eval.score() — THE DECISION VARIABLE. Never edited here.
    wb        v1 plus word-boundary matching for expect tokens <= 3 chars. Diagnostic only:
              gold 'AI' matches the 'ai' inside chair/maintain/available/said, so G003 and
              L010 pass on essentially any English answer. Reported, never decisive —
              11 of the 22 TABULAR invariant golds also have <=3-char expects (T19 'BC'
              must not become \bBC\b, which would stop matching "OBC"), so switching the
              invariant's own ruler mid-flight would make it incomparable to its baseline.
    rotated   v1, but each answer scored against the NEXT question's gold. This is the
              artifact floor: whatever it scores was bought by length and vocabulary, not
              by answering. A real gain must exceed its own rotated arm.
