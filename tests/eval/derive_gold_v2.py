"""Repair the stresskit gold derivation (Phase-B). CPU-only; no model, no GPU.

The stresskit ships HUMAN-authored `expected_answer` prose (plus answer_span /
supporting_docs), authored before this branch existed. `adapt_golden.py::derive_gold`
regex-scrapes that prose into substring anchors, and three properties of that scrape make
the resulting metric unable to recognise a correct answer:

  1. NUM_RE splits Indian digit grouping. "Rs. 2,96,35,000" becomes the four anchors
     2 / 96 / 35 / 000, of which "2" and "000" are free in any numeric answer while the
     real figure is required nowhere. The same fault yields an anchor 142000 that the
     corpus -- which writes 1,42,000 -- never contains.
  2. CODE_RE lifts acronyms out of the human's prose ("CSE is best") even when the corpus
     only ever writes the expansion ("Computer Science and Engineering"). A factually
     perfect answer quoting the corpus is then scored FAIL. Verified: CSE, DPDP and PG
     appear zero times across the 12 corpus documents.
  3. Anchors are all-or-nothing under `contains`, so a figure the human DERIVED by
     arithmetic (5.13 = 4.62 + 0.513; the 2,96,35,000 total) sits in the same conjunction
     as figures quoted from a table -- and one unquotable token fails the whole question
     regardless of how much reasoning the answer got right.

The rules below are mechanical, blind to any system answer, and re-runnable by an auditor
from the kit plus the corpus:

  R1 NUMBER NORMALISATION - commas inside digit runs are stripped on BOTH sides before
     matching, so 1,42,000 == 142000, and a grouped figure yields ONE anchor, not four.
  R2 CORPUS-PROVABLE ALIASES - an acronym anchor is satisfied by any corpus phrase whose
     significant-word initials match it (Computer Science and Engineering -> CSE; Digital
     Personal Data Protection Act -> DPDP by prefix). Aliases are DERIVED from the corpus,
     never typed here, and each is printed with the phrase it came from in the audit file.
  R3 REQUIRED vs BONUS - an anchor with no corpus-provable form (verbatim, normalised or
     aliased) cannot be quoted from the documents, so it is a DERIVED anchor: recorded as
     `bonus` and scored as its own sub-metric. This is deliberately not the same as
     deleting it. Those anchors are the arithmetic questions -- the only part of the
     GLOBAL slice that measures reasoning rather than retrieval -- so they stay visible,
     just not conjoined with the quotable ones.

Short anchors (<=3 chars) additionally match on word boundaries, so an 'AI' anchor stops
matching the "ai" inside chair/maintain/available/said.

Writes tests/eval/golden_stress_v2.json + golden_stress_v2_audit.md. The v1 file is NOT
touched and remains the decision variable; v2 is reported alongside it.
