"""
Golden-set evaluation runner (Phase 1 / CR3).

Runs each question in golden_set.json through the LIVE retrieval system exactly
as the API does (retrieval.router.QueryRouter + generation.answer), scores the
answer against a hand-verified gold, and reports per-route + overall accuracy.

Standalone (not a pytest test) so it can run against the real tenant_1 corpus
without the audit/ conftest import chain. Read-only: never writes tenant data.

Usage:
    python tests/eval/run_eval.py                      # full run, prints report
    python tests/eval/run_eval.py --out baseline.json  # also dump machine result
    python tests/eval/run_eval.py --limit 5            # first N questions (smoke)
    python tests/eval/run_eval.py --answers runs/x.jsonl [--resume]   # RUN/SCORE split

RUN/SCORE split (Phase-B): with --answers, every question's FULL answer, its length and
its wall-clock are appended to a JSONL file as they are produced. Scoring then becomes a
free CPU replay over that file (tests/eval/score_answers.py) — so a scorer variant costs
no GPU, and no scorer can be written *after* seeing the numbers it is supposed to judge:
the answers are frozen on disk first. --resume skips ids already present, so a run killed
mid-way (or a dead Ollama) does not cost the whole eval.

The JSONL holds raw answer text, which on tenant_1 contains student names — it is
gitignored (tests/eval/*.jsonl) for the same reason *_results.json is.

Scoring modes (per question `gold.mode`):
    contains      answer must contain EVERY string in gold.expect (case-insensitive)
    contains_any  answer must contain AT LEAST ONE string in gold.expect
    insufficient  answer must signal missing evidence ("don't have enough", etc.)
