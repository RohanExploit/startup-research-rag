"""
Unit tests for the analytical template matcher (retrieval/sql_templates).

The hermetic tests assert match_template() maps varied phrasings to the right
template WITHOUT a DB or LLM — they prove the new templates (student_count,
result_count, bottom_by_sgpa, count_sgpa_at_least, supplementary_count)
generalize across wording and do NOT shadow the pre-existing templates.

The real-data tests (skipped when tenant_1 analytics is absent, e.g. CI) check
the templates return the correct known values.
