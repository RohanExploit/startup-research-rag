"""The student-corpus world model — one source of truth for the PDFs rendered from it.

This follows the discipline set out in tests/eval/bench/world.py: facts are split across
documents on purpose, nothing here is random (no seeds, no generated filler — a fixed,
hand-checked world so a regression is always a system change and never a corpus change),
and several distractors are deliberate rather than accidental. See the comment above each
distractor below for what it tests.

The institute, every person, every roll number, phone number and email in this module are
INVENTED. This is the whole point of building a synthetic corpus: a PII-free document set
can be committed, made public, and bundled into an app, which real student records never
can. "Konkan Ratna Institute of Engineering and Technology" was checked against a live web
search before being chosen and does not match any real institution; do not rename it to
match one. It is deliberately NOT "Sahyadri Institute of Technology" (tests/eval/bench's
fictional institute — that is benchmark data and must stay uncontaminated) and NOT any real
college. Its affiliating university, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Technological University
(DBATU), Lonere, IS real — the only state technological university in Maharashtra — exactly
as tests/eval/bench/world.py affiliates its fictional SIT to the real Shivaji University:
a real affiliating body lends the corpus's cross-references (fee circulars, exam
regulations) their ordinary texture without claiming any specific college is real.

Every phone number in this module (institute switchboard included) uses the block reserved
for fiction, +91 90000 xxxxx, enforced by tests/test_student_world.py. Holiday dates for
2026 and 2027 were checked against a live gazetted holiday calendar (officeholidays.com,
2026-08-29) rather than reconstructed from memory, because a lunar festival date is a
specific checkable fact and getting one wrong would quietly break the "hand-checked" bar
the rest of this module holds itself to.
